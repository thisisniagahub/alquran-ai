# TypeScript Errors - Non-Critical

## Status: ⚠️ Type Safety Warnings (Not Runtime Errors)

The TypeScript compiler shows type errors related to Expo Router v5's strict route typing. These are **not runtime errors** - the app will work correctly, but we should fix them for production.

## Issue
Expo Router v5 has strict typing that requires routes to be defined in the type system. The errors are about route strings not matching the generated route types.

## Impact
- ✅ App functionality: **NOT AFFECTED**
- ✅ Runtime execution: **WORKS FINE**
- ⚠️ Type safety: **Can be improved**

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Type Assertion (Quickest)
Add `as any` to router.push/replace calls:
```typescript
router.push('/ai-chat' as any)
```

### Option 2: Use Href Helper (Recommended)
```typescript
import { Href } from 'expo-router';
router.push('/ai-chat' as Href)
```

### Option 3: Generate Types (Best for Production)
Run Expo's type generation:
```bash
cd /app/frontend
npx expo customize tsconfig.json
```

## Affected Files (23 errors total)
- app/(auth)/login.tsx - 2 errors
- app/(auth)/signup.tsx - 1 error  
- app/(tabs)/bookmarks.tsx - 1 error
- app/(tabs)/home.tsx - 6 errors
- app/(tabs)/profile.tsx - 6 errors
- app/(tabs)/read.tsx - 2 errors
- app/index.tsx - 2 errors
- app/prayer-times.tsx - 1 error
- app/progress.tsx - 2 errors

## Recommendation
These errors can be ignored for testing purposes. Fix them before production deployment by adding type assertions or generating proper route types.

## Current Status
✅ All screens implemented and functional
✅ Navigation working correctly
⚠️ Type safety can be improved
